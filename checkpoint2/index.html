          <a href="https://shelbyinloes.github.io/web-workbook/03week/airplane/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/siteone.png" /></a><br />
          <p>I was given a picture of a page to recreate, with only a few images to use. This project was just for asthetics. The goal was to make the colors, sizing, and overall design to look as close to the original as possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4 site" >
          <a href="https://shelbyinloes.github.io/web-workbook/04week/nasa/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/sitetwo.png" /></a><br />
          <p>This website goal was similar to the first, where I was given an example page to follow. The differnce was that we had just leanred about flex box and we needed to get all of the pixel spacing right according to the example. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4 site">
          <a href="https://shelbyinloes.github.io/web-workbook/05week/news-website/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/sitesix.png" /></a><br />
          <p>This project was the first one we learned after media queries. The object of the homework was to duplicate an example given, and make it responsive with media queries only. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4 site">
          <a href="https://shelbyinloes.github.io/web-workbook/04week/welcome-to-our-site/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/sitefour.png" /></a><br />
          <p>This project was similar to the last in that we used media queries (no bootstrap) to make the site responsive and change colors when doing so.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4 site">
          <a href="https://shelbyinloes.github.io/web-workbook/05week/news-website/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/sitefive.png" /></a><br />
          <p>This news website was my first main project using bootstrap grids. I was given an example of how the site should look, but it was up to me on what content we placed inside of it.</p>

          <p>Dice was the first javascript project I worked on. Our goal was to output various variables such as a pair, three of a kind, and a full house (and more!)</p>

          <p>Hello and as you already know - my name is Shelby and I am a web developer. I enjoy front-end web development and making beautiful creations. I didn't know much about the development side of things until after college. Once I was working in 'the real world' I realized I wanted more out of a career. When I first tried simple tutorials for HTML and CSS I was immediately hooked. It was so intriguing to me that I could type something into my computer, and instananeously see what a browser could render. Not only do I get immediate feedback, but I get the ability to create and build anything of my own. I hope to be able to share my passions with you.</p>
