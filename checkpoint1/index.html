        <h1>- Who We Are -</h1>
      </div>
      <p>The idea for Maximize the Game started many years ago when founder Rebecca Harper was in high school. She was a three sport athlete at the time playing soccer, basketball, and running track. She struggled each season transfering her athletic abilities to fit each sport. Rebecca then started doing her own research but had a hard time finding the specifics of training she was looking for. This struggle continued while she was in college and beyond. </p>
      <p>Once Rebecca was grown and having kids of her own, she wanted to make sure her kids had the absolute best resources to excell in the sports of their choice. Her and her husband were eager to find someone great. The struggle came when trying to find trainers because there was no single site who had pages for every trainers. It was exhausting searching through countless websites and knowing there were still trainers who did not have a personal site as well. Thus, the idea for Maximize the Game was born.</p>
      <p>Since it's begginings in 2008, the MTG network has expanded through 32 states - helping athletes all over! Not only does it give athletes a chance to find the resources they need, it gives the trainers a chance to market and find clients. MTG started out small, but has the desire to "Maximize the Game" for athletes everywhere.</p>
